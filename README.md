# LOGISTIC-REGRESSION-MODEL

Logistic regression is very common statiscal tool used in medicine, business analytics and engineering to predict binary variables in a data set.
This is a achieved by fitting the data in a logistic function bounded by 1 and 0

The data used in this project show the prevalence of diabetes in a population of women while other data about the women is also given
Since a person can either have diabetes or not this binary variable will be our target varible while all the other pieces of data can be used as our features.
With use of basic machine learning algorithms we can arrive at a resonable model to predict the probabilty of diabetes on other women of the same population.

In the data provided as .csv file, using the matplotlib module we can generate the histogram below which shows the distribution of the data being either a zero or one.

The logistic function models the data to fit the curve below where the value of  Ïƒ(X) is given by the function below.
